# Stock-Data-Analysis_with_Risk-and-Value-Prediction
The stock market has always been a fascinating topic for me. And recently I wanted to learn more about them. So I tried to write a program where I could analyze all the data of any stock I want (data is taken from yahoo finance and alpha vantage) and know about its variance, trade increment, decrement, and etc. Apart from analyzing and leaning about stock's historical data, I have tried to know about its risk as if I want to buy a stock on any particular day then what will be the risk in it and at worse, how much money I would be loosing on buying it. As we know, most of the stocks are co-dependent on each other whether directly or inversely, so I have added a heat map for the already listed 32 stocks(mix of all the major genres) which tells us about their correlativity and codependent with numbers and colors. At last, I have tried to predict the closing price of stocks in the future (30days in this code) with regression and neural network models. I have successfully created a model that predicts the future stock price with 97.4%accuracy. Apart from all the above-listed functions, I have added various other small features that will help the user in analyzing and predicting our data with more accuracy.
