# Stock-Data-Analysis_with_Risk-and-Value-Prediction
Stock market has always been a fascinating topic for me. And recently I wanted to learn more about them. So i tried to write a proggrame where I could analyse all the data of any stock i want (data is taken from yahoo finance and alpha vantage) and know about it's variance, trade increment, decrement, and etc.
Apart from analysing and leaning about stock's historical data, I have tried to know about it's risk as in if i want to buy a stock on any particular day then what will be the risk in it and at worse, how much money I would be loosing on buying it.
As we know, most of the stocks are co-dependent on each other wheter directly or inversely, so i have added an heat map for the already listed 32 stocks(mix of all the major genres) which tells us about their corelativity and codependent with numbers and colors.
At last, i have tried to predict the closing price of stocks in future (30days in this code) with regression and neural network model. I have sucessfully created a model that predict the future stock price with 97.4%accuracy.
Apart from all the above listed functions, i have added various other small features that will help the user in analysing and predicting our data with more accuracy.
